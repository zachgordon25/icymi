# In Case You Missed It

Do you ever want to know what you missed by not going to that concert? In Case You Missed It provides you with the setlist from that magical show. This project came with a lot of challenges. This was the first project I did that didn't use a language that is a part of the JavaScript ecosystem. It took some time to get comfortable with the syntax and structure. I learned a lot about the importance of research and development during these past couple of weeks. If I had more time I would seed some more data and style it a bit more.
